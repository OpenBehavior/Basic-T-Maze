# Basic-T-Maze

A 3D-printed T-Maze and sliding doors. The original design can be easily modified through any CAD platform. 

The apparatus presented here consists of a three-part print (the Maze and two sliding doors) and it requires no assembly. This project is easily customizable, download and edit the .stl files as needed, or feel free to print directly if the default meets your needs. PLA and PETG are particularly recommended for experiments with fish as these two materials are safest to use in water due to their stability and slow degradation.

Designed and validated by Kevin Chavez-Lopez on behalf of the OpenBehavior project.
